<h1> Humanize your experince listening to music products on Spotify</h1>

## Inspiration: 

> Palmer Lucky's criticism of Spotify that algorithmic feeds dehumanize artists by reducing music to a product, and turn the listener into a passive receptacle rather than an active curator. I came up with an idea to humanize spotify listening experience to human users of Spotify including myself.

Using Spotipy python library to interact with Spotify Web API, I am creating an automated app allowing users of Spotify to receive weekly reports on their latest musical escapades!
